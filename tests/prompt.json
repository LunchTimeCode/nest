  "prompt": "Cauliflower: In this recipe, you're basically making cauliflower rice as the base for your crust. My top tip? You MUST drain the cooked cauliflower, as it keeps the crust dry and encourages crisping while it bakes.\n    Egg: Adding an egg to our cauliflower mixture helps to keep it together and form a cohesive crust.\n    Mozzarella & Parmesan: While we of course top our pizza with cheese, I also chose to add cheese to the crust to give more texture and flavor. A combination of freshly shredded mozzarella and Parmesan is my favorite—make sure to use freshly shredded!\n    Marinara: You have a few options here. You can use marinara or pizza sauce, and you can make it homemade (it truly is worth the extra effort) or buy it store-bought if you’re in a pinch.\n    Garlic: I add a few cloves of minced garlic on top of the cheese to pack in even more flavor to the entire pizza.\n    Toppings: For our toppings, I’m taking inspiration from the classic Caprese salad. Halved cherry or grape tomatoes go on top, along with fresh torn basil and balsamic glaze. That being said, you can add whatever toppings you please!"
